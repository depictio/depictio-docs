Despite numerous available tools, there's a notable absence of platforms designed for seamless integration with production workflows.</p> Our Solution <p>Depictio addresses this gap with a generic, centralized platform that integrates workflow output data to build interactive dashboards. It provides scalable, flexible, and open-source solutions for researchers handling large datasets from any execution engine (Nextflow, Snakemake, Galaxy, R, etc.).</p> Why Depictio? No Code Required <p>Create interactive dashboards without writing code. Drag and drop components, configure visualizations through the UI.</p> Workflow Integration <p>Connect directly to Nextflow, Snakemake, Galaxy outputs. Automatically ingest results from production pipelines.</p> Shareable &amp; Reproducible <p>Export dashboards as YAML for version control. Share with collaborators, deploy across environments.</p> Real-time Exploration <p>Filter and interact with data in real-time.
