# Features

## Overview

Depictio is built to address the challenges of visualizing and analyzing large-scale bioinformatics datasets generated by production workflows like [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/), [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/), or the [Snakemake Workflow Catalog](https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-workflow-catalog/). It provides a user-friendly interface for creating interactive dashboards that can be shared with collaborators, making it easier to explore and interpret complex data.

Its key capabilities include:

- **Interactive Dashboards** for real-time data exploration
- **Scalable Architecture** for handling large datasets
- **Data Integration** from multiple sources
- **User Management** for secure access control
- **Security Features** with restricted code execution and comprehensive protection
- **Customizable Components** for tailored visualizations

## In This Section

- [Architecture](architecture.md) - Detailed overview of Depictio's microservices architecture
- [Modularity](modularity.md) - Information about Depictio's modular design and extensibility
- [Security](security.md) - Comprehensive security features and restricted code execution

## Key Components

Depictio consists of several integrated components:

- **Backend API** (FastAPI) - Handles data processing and business logic
- **Frontend** (Plotly Dash) - Provides the user interface
- **Database** (MongoDB) - Stores metadata and configurations
- **Storage** (MinIO) - Manages data files and assets

Explore the detailed documentation to learn more about each feature and how they work together to provide a comprehensive visualization platform.
