!!! warning
    * Depictio is currently in development and is not yet ready for production use. We currently only support an installation using Docker Compose, Kubernetes support is in development.
    * This guide assumes you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine. If not, please follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
    * A current limitation of the system is that the data to be ingested into depictio needs to be accessible by the depictio backend. This means that the data needs to be mounted into the docker container. This is a limitation we are working on addressing in the future.
    * We currently don't offer the possibility use existing public/private keys for token generation. Keys will be automatically generated by the system and stored in the `depictio/keys` folder.
    * We currently rely on our own MinIO S3 bucket management instance for data storage. In the future, we plan to support other S3-compatible services.
