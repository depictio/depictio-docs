# Unauthenticated Mode

## Overview

### What is Unauthenticated Mode?

In unauthenticated mode, user lands as a temporary anonymous user with limited access. This anonymous user can only access the existing **public dashboards** and play with the interactive features in a stateless manner (no database persistence), but cannot create or modify dashboards. This mode is ideal for quick demonstrations or public sharing of dashboards without requiring user authentication.

If the user wants to create its own dashboard, modify existing ones using the same dataset, or create its own basic project and upload a dataset, they can switch to a temporary authenticated user mode. The temporary user will have a limited session duration (24h by default), after which dashboards will be cleared.

Example unauthenticated mode URL is available on documentation landing page: [https://depictio.github.io/depictio-docs/latest/](https://depictio.github.io/depictio-docs/latest/).

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Enable unauthenticated mode by setting these environment variables:

```bash
# Enable unauthenticated access
DEPICTIO_AUTH_UNAUTHENTICATED_MODE=true

# Configure anonymous user settings
DEPICTIO_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_USER_EMAIL=anonymous@depict.io
DEPICTIO_AUTH_TEMPORARY_USER_EXPIRY_HOURS=24
```

### Helm Deployment

For Kubernetes deployments, use the provided values files:

```bash
# Deploy with unauthenticated mode
helm upgrade --install your-release ./helm-charts/depictio \
  -f ./helm-charts/depictio/values.yaml \
  -f ./helm-charts/depictio/values-unauth.yaml \
  -n your-namespace
```

## Limitations

- **Session-Based**: Data and dashboards expire after configured time
- **No Persistence**: User data is not permanently stored
- **No User Management**: No user accounts, groups, or permissions
- **Temporary Storage**: All content is ephemeral

## Use Cases

### Scientific Outreach and Demonstrations

- Public sharing of dashboards
- Public demos and presentations

### Educational Use

- Training sessions
- Workshops and tutorials
- Proof-of-concept deployments

## Security Considerations

- **Public Access**: Anyone can access the deployment
- **Data Sensitivity**: Only use with non-sensitive, public data (e.g., public & published datasets ; data powering the visualizations could be extracted from the dashboard by scrapping the page)
- **Resource Limits**: Configure appropriate resource constraints
- **Network Security**: Use proper network isolation and ingress controls
