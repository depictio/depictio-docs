## Download example data

Publically available data can be downloaded by cloning the following repo:

`git clone https://github.com/weber8thomas/depictio-data.git`

One of the datasets (`StrandSeq/HGSVC`) corresponds to HGSVC StranSeq runs, processed using the MosaiCatcher pipeline. The MosaiCatcher pipeline is a Strand-Seq SV calling framework. The pipeline is available [here](https://github.com/friendsofstrandseq/mosaicatcher-pipeline). 


## YAML configuration

An example YAML configuration file corresponding to the `StrandSeq/HGSVC` is available [here](./configs/mosaicatcher_pipeline/mosaicatcher_pipeline.yaml). The configuration file is used to define the workflows and data collections that are available in the system.
