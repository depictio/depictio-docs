# Biological Use-Cases

Depictio is currently being developed with two primary workflows employed as use-cases :

- Single-cell Structural Variations from Strand-seq data: Focus on cancer subclonal characterisation and genome phasing.
- Diatom Interactions and Climate Change Studies: Analysis of diatom symbioses in marine biology, in collaboration with the Vincent group and TREC.
